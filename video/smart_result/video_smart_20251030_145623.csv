갑자기 비가 쏟아져 모두가 뛰어가는 도심의 모습을 영상으로 만들어줘,
,"[{'optimizedPrompt': '[Main Subject]\nA diverse group of office workers, varying in age, gender, and attire, are present on a rainy urban street surrounded by modern office buildings.\n\n[Context]\nCityscape filled with high-rise company buildings, wet pavements, and glistening reflections from the sudden pouring rain. Dark, dense clouds fill the sky, and heavy raindrops are visibly falling everywhere.\n\n[Action]\nSeveral office workers abruptly run across the slick, rain-soaked sidewalks, some hurriedly opening umbrellas, others leaping to avoid puddles. Some nearly slip on the wet pavement as they rush towards the shelter of nearby office entrances. Continuous dodging of puddles and quick glances upwards at the sky are apparent.\n\n[Style]\nCinematic realism with heightened contrast to emphasize wet reflective surfaces, deep grays and blues dominating the color palette, authentic movement, and dynamic facial expressions of urgency. Focus on the realism of rain and textures of clothing and urban environment.\n\n[Camera Motion]\nDynamic handheld tracking shot, starting with a wide view of the city street, then panning and following key office workers as they run. Occasional quick zoom-ins on expressions and details like water splashing from puddles. Camera moves at street level to immerse the viewer in the hustle.\n\n[Composition]\nWide shot of a busy city street, composition leading deep between tall office buildings. Multiple layers: foreground (workers running), midground (rain and puddles), background (office buildings in the downpour). Occasional medium shots of individual workers’ panicked faces, close-ups of feet avoiding puddles and umbrellas opening.\n\n[Atmosphere]\nIntensely urgent and chaotic, crowded city sounds muffled by heavy rainfall, dramatic lighting from reflections and gray overcast sky. The air feels electric due to the torrential downpour. Movements are brisk and hurried.\n\n[Additional Rule]\nDo not include any blur, distortion, or unwanted objects. Focus on the rain’s clarity, the urgency of the office workers, and the genuine urban environment. Ensure only city elements, rain, office workers, and weather-related actions are visually present.\n\n[Scripts]\n<Office Worker 1: ""It\'s pouring! Quick, get under the awning!""> <Office Worker 2: ""Watch out for the puddles—it\'s so slippery!""> <Office Worker 3: ""My umbrella, where is it—ah, there!"">', 'koreanSummary': '갑작스러운 폭우에 회사원들이 도심의 비오는 거리에서 급히 달려 우산을 펴고 물웅덩이를 피해가는 긴박한 장면'}]"
